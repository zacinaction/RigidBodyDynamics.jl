    attach!(mechanism, predecessor, joint, jointToPredecessor, successor, successorToJoint)

Attach `successor` to `predecessor` using `joint`.

See [`Joint`](@ref) for definitions of the terms successor and predecessor.

The `Transform3D`s `jointToPredecessor` and `successorToJoint` define where
`joint` is attached to each body. `jointToPredecessor` should define
`frame_before(joint)` with respect to any frame fixed to `predecessor`, and likewise
`successorToJoint` should define any frame fixed to `successor` with respect to
`frame_after(joint)`.

`predecessor` is required to already be among the bodies of the `Mechanism`.

If `successor` is not yet a part of the `Mechanism`, it will be added to the
`Mechanism`. Otherwise, the `joint` will be treated as a non-tree edge in the
`Mechanism`, effectively creating a loop constraint that will be enforced
using Lagrange multipliers (as opposed to using recursive algorithms).
